# PPOL 5203 - Problem Set 3

This repository contains your third problem set for Data Science I: Foundations. You will be working with some electoral data! 

**Deadline:** 11:59pm of October 27

## General Rules for Problem Sets


- (i) all code must run;

- (ii) solutions should be readable

    -   Code should be thoroughly commented - the Professor/TA should be able to understand the code purpose by reading the comment,
    -   Coding solutions should be broken up into individual code chunks in Jupyter, not clumped together into one large code chunk (See examples in class or reach out to the TA/Professor if this is unclear),
    -   Each student-defined function must contain a doc string explaining what the function does, each input argument, and what the function returns;

- (iii) Commentary, responses, and/or solutions should all be written in Markdown and explain sufficiently the outpus.

- (iv) All solutions must be completed in Python.

**This is a Python assignment. Take these rules seriously**

## Step by Step to submit your assignment

You should be familiar with the steps required to work on this repository. 

In any case, if you follow the steps below, you should be able to solve all required tasks. 

## Working locally in your assignment

### Step 1

The first step is to clone your assignment to your local machine

```
git clone <repository_name>
```

This will create a folder in your local working directory. This folder is a local GitHub repository. You should `cd` into that folder. 

### Step 2

Your problem set is fully described in the notebook `_ps_set2.ipynb`. 

You can open `ipynb` using jupyter notebooks. 

Read your assignment carefully. 

All your assignment is contained in the notebook

### Step 3

Submit your assignment via GitHub, via stage, commit, and push. 

- Remember: this is an individual assignment.
- I will consider your last commit as your final submission.

If you have any questions, ask me or your TA. 

Enjoy!!
